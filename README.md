Getting and Cleaning Data
=========================

This is the final assignment for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data MOOC.
Assignment details can be found in the 'Assignments' section of the course.

In brief, we are asked to take some data from [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront
.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.
cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip), merge several
data sets, extract a subset, tidy it, summarise it and write the summary of the
subset to a text file.

This repository contains:

*	**Code\_Book.md** that provides a brief description of process undertaken
	to produce the data.

*	**run\_analysis.R** has the R script used to load and process the data

*	**summary.md** that has the processed summary.
